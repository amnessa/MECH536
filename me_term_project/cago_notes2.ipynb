    "I'll review each of your uploaded `.ipynb` files and identify what adjustments are needed to simplify and align them with your requirements. I'll also mention if you need to create a new file or combine functionalities. Let me analyze the contents of your uploaded files to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the summaries of the notebooks, here's an evaluation of their contents, adjustments needed, and whether you require new files:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. 08_predictive_model.ipynb**\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "- Handles the predictive model pipeline using features (`VGG16_fc1_features_std.pickle`).\n",
    "- Uses `PCA` and clustering for feature manipulation and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjustments:\n",
    "- **Simplify**: Retain only the feature processing and clustering logic.\n",
    "- Remove: Advanced metrics, excessive plots, or steps irrelevant to dynamic feedback.\n",
    "- **Feedback Integration**: Add a mechanism to check predictions, update clusters, and handle new classes interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. 07_kmeans n_clusters n_iter.ipynb**\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "- Explores k-means clustering with different numbers of clusters and iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjustments:\n",
    "- **Simplify**: Focus on k-means with a fixed `n_clusters` and remove excessive experimentation.\n",
    "- **Feedback Integration**: Add functionality to dynamically re-cluster or add a new cluster based on user feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. 06_pca_num_components_whiten_nowhiten.ipynb**\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "- Performs PCA with different numbers of components and investigates the effect of whitening.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjustments:\n",
    "- **Simplify**: Fix PCA components (e.g., 50) and remove comparisons between whitening and non-whitening.\n",
    "- **Feedback Integration**: Ensure PCA is integrated for feature extraction before clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. 05_different_layers.ipynb**\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "- Compares the performance of features extracted from different layers of VGG16.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjustments:\n",
    "- **Simplify**: Fix the layer you want to extract features from (e.g., `fc1`) and remove layer-by-layer comparisons.\n",
    "- Focus only on the chosen feature extractor for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. 04_no_histeq.ipynb**\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "- Processes images without histogram equalization and extracts features (`VGG16_fc1_features_NoHistEQ.pickle`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjustments:\n",
    "- **Simplify**: Standardize the preprocessing pipeline (e.g., decide whether to use histogram equalization or not).\n",
    "- Remove alternate preprocessing methods unless needed for experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. 03_standard.ipynb**\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "- A standard pipeline using preprocessed features (`VGG16_fc1_features_std.pickle`) for clustering and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjustments:\n",
    "- Retain this as a **base notebook** for your main pipeline (feature extraction, clustering, feedback).\n",
    "- Simplify by removing redundant code and ensuring alignment with the simplified goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. 02_vgg-features.ipynb**\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "- Extracts features from images using the VGG16 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjustments:\n",
    "- Keep as-is, but fix the feature extraction layer to `fc1` and ensure it aligns with the clustering pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. 01_preprocess.ipynb**\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "- Preprocesses images from the dataset (resizing, histogram equalization, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjustments:\n",
    "- Standardize preprocessing (e.g., apply resizing and histogram equalization).\n",
    "- Ensure this notebook outputs a consistent dataset ready for feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Do You Need a New File?**\n",
    "Yes, you need a **feedback integration file** that combines the simplified pipelines and introduces a mechanism for:\n",
    "1. Accepting user feedback on clustering results.\n",
    "2. Updating clusters dynamically (re-cluster or add new clusters).\n",
    "3. Handling new data to classify it based on corrected clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Proposed Pipeline Structure**\n",
    "1. **Preprocessing** (from `01_preprocess.ipynb`).\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction** (from `02_vgg-features.ipynb`).\n",
    "3. **Clustering** (from `03_standard.ipynb` or `07_kmeans n_clusters n_iter.ipynb`).\n",
    "4. **Feedback Mechanism** (new file, integrated with clustering).\n",
    "5. **Dynamic Re-Clustering** (enhanced version of `08_predictive_model.ipynb`).\n",
