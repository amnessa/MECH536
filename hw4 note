nov 12 24 theres gonna be a big quiz in this week

so for example after scanning a straight wall or some perfect surface. We would get 3 dimensional vector 2 for surface location 1 for distance from sensor point.

zero mean your data first

fat wide short matrix refers to M that has more columns, skinny tall is the reverse

---

-> Small SVD task

show that The singular values of matrix M are the square root of the eigenvalues of M^TM or MM^T

left Singular vectors are eigenvectors of MM^T = U Sigma V^T V sigma U^-1

right Singular vectors are eigenvectors of M^TM 

theres a code in slide also in hoca's math github function that utilizes svd maybe more. Check closely
